# LL-JSON

This is a fork of JSON For Construct 2, for adding a few more features I wanted.

If you have any general contributions, go make a pull request on
[the original](https://github.com/FrenchYann/JSON_for_construct2).

If you specifically want to improve a feature exclusive to this repo,
or if you want to complain about some antipattern in my code, then go
ahead and submit it here instead.

For the record, C2 > C3.
